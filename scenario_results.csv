--- Reflection --- 
The above sequence of scenarios works and I think it is adequate for a WHOLE POPULATION analysis. 
  But if we do INDIVIDUAL analysis the satisficing level should be tightened! And we illustrate individual CONDITIONS per pulp plant!
  The individual conditions MIGHT find 5st LP+elc and 2st HP+COP conditions - And overall higher densities!
If using PRIM on whole population: LP+elc is a winnner in BALANCED and in ZEROBIOMASS
  But Värö is weirdly bad. Especially in LP-ZEROBIOMASS. It has JUST too little steam: this is my claim! I launched PRIM on Värö in this scenario and found:
    If we also restrict dimensions of rate/factor_recovery: then less CO2 exists and steam LP is viable for Värö again! <3
