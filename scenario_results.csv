Difficult to set thresholds. At ZeroBiomass we most likely need around 200-400 MWh/kt (i.e. 1 GJ/t) of penalty_services no matter what!

--- Reflection --- 
The above sequence of scenarios works and I think it is adequate for a WHOLE POPULATION analysis. 
  But if we do INDIVIDUAL analysis the satisficing level should be tightened! And we illustrate individual CONDITIONS per pulp plant!
  The individual conditions MIGHT find 5st LP+elc and 2st HP+COP conditions - And overall higher densities!
If using PRIM on whole population: LP+elc is a winnner in BALANCED and in ZEROBIOMASS
  But Värö is weirdly bad. Especially in LP-ZEROBIOMASS. It has JUST too little steam: this is my claim! I launched PRIM on Värö in this scenario and found:
    If we also restrict dimensions of rate/factor_recovery: then less CO2 exists and steam LP is viable for Värö again! <3


--- CHP sector ---
The jump between map1 and map2 is great! But the ZeroBiomass conditions are just unreliable.
A solution is to SEARCH for slightly easier thresholds to ensure PRIM works. But then still illustrate the tight thresholds in results! Will try this:
y = (filtered_outcomes["capture_cost"] < 150) & (filtered_outcomes["penalty_services"] < 300) & (filtered_outcomes["penalty_biomass"] < 500)

IMPORTANT: Using ["penalty_services"] < 200 works, but makes the biomass scenario terrible. So then map1 and map3 will be red, while map2 will be green.
Given this, I should probably redo this analysis but for < 300. This gives interesting result that Tlow matters, and map1 is red map2 is green map3 is orange.

Thresholds:
y = (filtered_outcomes["capture_cost"] < 100) & (filtered_outcomes["penalty_services"] < 200) & (filtered_outcomes["penalty_biomass"] < 500)
