    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This file describes the CCS retrofit models. In the main article, the overall modelling steps are described as: (1) estimating the nominal energy balance from the database parameters, (2) calculating flue gases, (3) sizing an Aspen Plus model of amine capture, compression and liquefaction, (4) determining the new energy balance after integrating the capture process and (5) estimating capital and operational expenditures. Below, the article figure is re-printed to provide an overview of these steps.\n",

    "Notably, many theoretical and modelling details have been described by e.g. Kumar et al. (2023), Biermann et al. (2019) and Onarheim et al. (2017). However, this file mainly elaborates on model structure and key assumptions specific to this study. _Not all modelling steps and assumptions are described here, as the models contain many calculation steps. But the main features are presented_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models and data are collected in the GitHub repository BECCS-Sweden. While many other files also populate the repo, it's overall structure is illustrated below. The controller.py and model.py are the most important files. In each controller, you specify what plant data should be read and what uncertainties, levers and outcomes should be explored. The controller then calls the model in the corresponding model.py file repeatedly for a specified number of scenarios. Each model file consists of a set of functions corresponding to the modelling steps (1) to (5) previously outlined. These steps are detailed in the following sections."

    "### Determining an initial energy balance and preparing Aspen data\n",
    "The CCS retrofit models for woodchip- and waste-fired plants are very similar so only the woodchip-fired model will be used for demonstration purposes. Firstly, a __CHP__ plant object is constructed based on the plant of interest. This plant could e.g. be \"Värtaverket KVV8\" from the CHP plant data csv file. The nominal energy balance of this plant is then estimated based on the fuel, power and steam data. The __estimate_nominal_cycle()__ function essentially guesses various condensation pressures. The function stops when the power and heat generated matches the values of the CHP plant data. At this point, the steam states of the CHP have been estimated. "

    "The (wet) flue gas composition for woodchip- and waste-fired CHP plants were taken from Kumar et al. (2023) and Hammar (2022), respecitvely. The model was adapted to various flue gas flows between 3 and 170 kg/s and capture rates between 78 and 94 %. The results were saved to e.g. the AspenWoodchip.csv file, which is illustrated below. The key idea is that this data can be used to quickly estimate various outputs from the Aspen model by interpolating based on flue gas flow and capture rate. This lets us estimate model outputs for thousands of scenarios, without having to adjust the Aspen model manually for each scenario.\n",

    "## 3. The pulp mill models\n",
    "### Determining an initial energy balance and preparing Aspen data\n",
    "The CCS retrofit models for pulp mills follow a similar logic to those of CHP plants. Firstly, we specify some energy balance assumptions for all mills - mainly that the recovery boiler generates 18 GJ steam per air dried ton of pulp produced, and the various pulp mill processes demand 11 GJ steam per air dried ton of pulp produced (EU Joint Research Centre, 2015). We also assume the mills are operated 8000 hours per year. We decided to not model this as an uncertainty, as it would cause misalignment with the constant pulp production data used. Furthermore, we decided that the lowest pressure level of any steam stream would be 0.1 bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "After making these energy balnce assumptions, a __pulp_plant__ object is constructed based on any of the pulp mills in the data csv file. The nominal energy balance of this mill is then estimated using the __estimate_nominal_cycle()__ function. Here, the main goal is to determine how much excess steam could be available from the recovery and bark boilers, after steam has been used to cover mill process demands. This is done by calculating: the steam generated from the recovery boiler, i.e. 18 GJ times the production capacity; the steam generated from the bark boiler, i.e. a percent share of the steam generated from the recovery boiler (e.g. ~15 % at the Mönsterås pulp mill); and the steam demand for the kraft process, i.e. 11 GJ times the production capacity.

    "The function then estimates the massflow of available steam that could be expanded from live steam states down to low pressure (~4 bar) or condensing pressure (0.1 bar). The nominal power production can therefore also be calculated, as we assume this steam is expanded through turbines before being used to cover process demands (at ~4 bar).

    "Again, the model begins by calculating the amount of flue gases, feedstock use and CO2 generated using the __burn_fuel()__ function. This is where any extra bark boiler use is accounted for. Flue gas factors are estimated based on the modelled data used by Onarheim et al. (2017), notably the production capacity of 800 000 air dried tons per year and the flue gas data of their Table 2. These factors are then scaled to the production capacities of the mills considered in this study. For example, a mill producing 400 000 tons of pulp per year would produce roughly half as much flue gases as the Onarheim model mill. Again, the flue gases are considered ideal, i.e. 22.4 Nm3/kmol gas.

    "A key feature of the pulp CCS model is that _only one out of three energy supply strategies is employed in each scenario_. Their model implementation will now be described briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the mill owner could utilize high pressure, live steam to supply the capture plant reboiler with heat. This strategy, \"SteamHP\", has a dedicated function called __feed_then_condense()__. The function subtracts the reboiler duty from the available steam of the mill. The remaining steam is then expanded as normal to lower pressure levels. The various steam mass flows are then re-calculated and the relative loss in power generation is estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the mill owner could utilize low pressure steam (~4 bar) to supply the capture plant reboiler with heat. This strategy, \"SteamLP\", has a function called __expand_then_feed()__. The function first expands (through turbines, presumably) the live steam of the recovery and bark boilers to their respective low pressure levels. It then forms a merit order for supplying the reboiler heat demand. It first tries to supply the whole demand using low pressure recovery boiler steam. It then supplies any remaining heat demand with bark boiler steam. Should this be insufficient (which is unlikely), any remaining reboiler demand is assumed to be met by direct electric heating. Again, the various steam mass flows are then re-calculated and the relative loss in power generation is estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the mill owner could utilize the _theoretical option_ of heat pumps to cover the reboiler heat demand. This strategy, \"HeatPumps\", has it's dedicated function called __recover_and_supplement()__ and is inspired by the setup introduced by Jenssen et al. (2024). The idea is to lift the temperature of available excess heat of the mill to an appropriate reboiler temperature, i.e. above 120 C. Heat above 60 C is considered useful for this purpose, while recognizing that the temperature lift is large. Available excess heat above 60 C has been estimated by Cruz et al. (2024) as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q_{\\text{excess} \\geq 60^\\circ C} \\, [\\text{GWh p.a.}] = k + m \\times \\text{market pulp} \\, [\\text{air dried tons p.a.}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where k, m and the heat pump COP efficiency are scenario dependent. This excess heat is lifted to meet the reboiler heat demand at the expense of lost electricity (determined by the COP). In many scenarios this is insufficient to cover the reboiler demand. Again, a merit order is constructed where low pressure recovery boiler steam is prioritized to meet the remaining demand. If insufficient, then low pressure bark boiler steam is also utilized to meet the remaining demand. After the reboiler demand is met, the various steam flows are re-calculated and the relative loss of power generation  (including for heat pump work) is estimated."

    "Now, the new energy balance of the mill has been determined and CAPEX and OPEX can be calculated. The __CAPEX_MEA()__ calculations, including for fixed OPEX, are the same as the calculations used for CHP plants so we will not describe them again. The only difference is that the heat pump capacity for CHP plants is for upgrading capture plant excess heat, while heat pump capacity for pulp mills is for upgrading mill process excess heat. The __OPEX_MEA()__ function simply calculates the cost of foregone revenues from reduced power generation, the cost of any additional biomass feedstock and the cost of solvent makeup."
