WHAT I NEED TO DO TO FINISH THE MODELLING

1) Skim through how each model calculates things. Am I happy with this? For:
    a) CHP      -y
    b) Waste    -y
    c) Pulp     -y

2) Look through Tables 3-4 and decide on each range. Include a reference/motivation.    -y

3.1) Test the models for fewer scenarios. Also run PRIM on each. Are the results ok? For:
    a) CHP          - y
    b) Waste        - y
    c) Pulp         - y

4) Create Aspen data and redo the tests. Are the PRIM scenarios the same? For:
    a) Pulp
    b) Waste (possibly skip? unsure...)

NOW I HOPEFULLY HAVE ROBUST RESULTS. I MAY NEED TO RE-DEFINE ROBUSTNESS THRESHOLDS.

5) Clean up the code for publishing quality.
